# plugin_water_segmentation

Segments of the water flooded area from video taken from a street view camera. The algorithm is first extracting changes of brightness of the surface of the images in spatio-temporal dimension which is shown as a sinusoidal signal and second using the FFT algorithm to analyze the signal to recognize the possible area of where water is.
